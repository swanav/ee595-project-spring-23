## Problem Description

Network congestion is a major problem that can lead to slow or unreliable network performance. Congestion control algorithms have been developed to mitigate this problem, but selecting the most appropriate algorithm for a given network environment can be challenging. This proposal outlines a project to use machine learning to monitor network activity parameters and select the most appropriate congestion control algorithm in real-time.
